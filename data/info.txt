Well store the pokemons stats and stuff as an array of data, ill write here whats the pattern


each pokemon will have an index: 0,1,2,3, dragonite will be index 0.


so the file pokemon0.s will have a list of bytes containing the following data:

pokemon_index: .byte index, current hp, total hp

todo:
next stats index 0 of move, .., index 3 of move, stats
